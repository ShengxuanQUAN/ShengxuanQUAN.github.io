### Problem
(2–3 sentences: what problem, why it matters)

### Approach
- Model: WAE + CLaSS (controllable generation)
- Data: curated AMP datasets; schema harmonization; labels
- Evaluation: distributional diagnostics, property-guidance, failure mode analysis

### Evaluation & Reflection
- Bullet points with evidence (plots, logs, metrics, qualitative examples)
- If you have images, insert them here.

### Next steps
Generalization, mitigate α-helix bias, stronger multi-objective constraints.
